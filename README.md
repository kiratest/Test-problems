# Test-problems

1) For the first problem, I design a neural network which recognizes handwritten digits using Tensorflow. This is a problem which is trivial to a human 
but much more difficult for a machine, hence why we'll use some machine learning to solve it. The libraries which were used for this project
are numpy, pandas, matplotlib, tensorlow, sklearn and seaborn.

2) The second project was about writing a script in Python which would allow us to interact with the database and to perform CRUD operations.
I chose SQLite as our Database system.

3) When it comes to the third project, I implemented a YouTube API to calculate the total number of watch hours in any given YouTube
channel's playlist. If the particular playlist contains 24 videos, then we will first access this playlist via YouTube API and
then compute each video's duration in that playlist and finally add them up in the end. As an example, I chose one of the playlists of 
MrBeast channel.
